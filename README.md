## Purpose

The purpose of this code is to analyze the data from the BarSed Flume Experiment [link](https://www.designsafe-ci.org/data/browser/public/designsafe.storage.published/PRJ-1740/BARSED_DATA) so that an xBeach model can be created from it's results.

The repo will contain:
* Interactive python notebooks that do the processing
* A python library that contains functions that are used as the backend to process the data.
